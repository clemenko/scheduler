# Todo — WAVFD Scheduler

- [ ] create a menu item for the user to create a list of "my upcoming shifts" with a week and month range.
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness — review and fix layout on small screens (AppBar menu, Calendar, modals)
- [ ] Email capability — `sendEmail` util and `/send-reminders` route exist; query fixed, still needs SMTP config wired up
- [ ] email capability needs to be able to send a weekly reminder sunday night for upcoming shifts.
- [ ] add color picker in the admin settings page to change the header color
- [ ] add logo to the header to the left of the title. Add the setting to change it in the admin dashboard settings tab
- [ ] Production build — verify frontend Dockerfile uses `npm run build` (not dev server)
- [ ] perform a complete review of the code base looking for ways to optimize and secure the code
