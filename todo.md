# Todo — WAVFD Scheduler

- [ ] create a menu item for the user to create a list of "my upcoming shifts" with a week and month range.
- [ ] Splash/landing page — public-facing landing page before login
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness — review and fix layout on small screens (AppBar menu, Calendar, modals)
- [ ] Email capability — `sendEmail` util and `/send-reminders` route exist; query fixed, still needs SMTP config wired up
- [ ] Production build — verify frontend Dockerfile uses `npm run build` (not dev server)
